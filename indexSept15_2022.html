			<strong>Hey, you found my website &mdash; </strong>
		</div>
		<p>
			My email is <b>josh@joshpetersel.com</b>. Here's a few things that are important to me:
		</p>
		<h2 id=''><br>Writing</h2>
			<p>I write essays into <i>Google Docs</i>. I'm inspired by: <br>
				<ol>
					<li><b>My Village</b>: What do the people I care about, care about?</li>
					<li><b>Technology</b>: Where is technology trending? What's counterintuitive (or, often, absurd) about that; what should we do about it?</li>
					<li><b>Purpose</b>: How does a modern young adult, with more options &amp; fewer encumbrances than ever, create and derive meaning for themselves?</li>
					
				</ol>
				My metric of choice is dialogue, not clicks or views. I've shipped about once a month for over a decade, and consistently every 1,000 words I write turns into over 3,000 words in comments, replies, and new ideas from a few dozen loyal readers. So entries are really more than essays; they're kindling for conversation.<br><br>

				If that sounds cool, maybe we’ll get along. <b>Hi, I’m Josh.</b><br><br>

				The <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsQd81HoM8uAMsGKWeiyORkybQi_CRlQr0sZCfe-vX4/edit'>Table of Contents</a> houses all the published stuff. <a href='http://goo.gl/forms/rwtZWja4Ps'>Signing up</a> gets you new stuff hot off the presses, plus grants you access to <i>in-line side-comments</i>. If you want to see what that looks like, or you’re otherwise not sure where to start, check out <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlQlevmR-CVNODiaY-c1Y0FOAEp8kTzKXhANxbp1NlU/edit'>one of my old favorite entries</a>.<br><br>

				I designed &amp; coded this website because I think basic tech fluency is important (hey, see #2 above!), and because it was fun. I operate out of <i>Google Docs</i> instead of, say, Substack &amp; Discord, for Docs' unrivaled feature set: they're intuitive for most any computer user to navigate documents &amp; comment in-line; they offers some basic discretion &amp; obfuscation from search engines; there's nice Gmail integrations and you probably don't need to create some new login.
			</p>

		<h2 id='Etc'><br>Coaching</h2>
			<p>One way I pay it forward is by occasionally performing careers services (Resume, Search, and Interview prep) for young people who aspire to work in tech. If you’re hunting for your first tech job, my coaching is pro-bono. <br><br>
			
			I've helped folks land roles they love (Product Managers, Business Analysts, etc.) at growth startups to FAANG companies. My essay <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hVVFXpEom4SqAKpaskasct6qR7dWwlRz6kqWX0JRrA/edit>Getting a job at a Blockbuster</a> consolidates my broad industry observations and my most common pragmatic tactics. To find time for 1:1 perspective on your unique situation, drop me a line.
			</p>

		<h2 id='Things'><br>About</h2>
		<p>
			Professionally: I'm a Director at Spotify, where I build revenue systems and lead a team with the mission of making music accessible &amp; sustainable. I'm a fierce customer advocate. I'm a Harvard MBA, but don't identify with the mental image many seem to carry of that school's alums.  I <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nopc7-IOMhMV5LUesF864xuw9eN3uJ9hw2JKAvQFQJM/edit'>measure</a>, and often rely on data to make decisions, but also know when it's time to trust my experience &amp; instincts.<br><br>

			Personally: I live in Toronto; I'm a Brooklyn &amp; St Louis expat. <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNx0V_wczJ3s19I3GRDIllGKftEKRrTMjjAeP2pbAyE/edit'>I listen to albums, slowly</a>. I mentor with Big Brothers / Big Sisters. My favorite sport is surfing; my favorite game is Berlin-style ping-pong.

		<h2 id='Signature'><br>See ya</h2>
			<p>If the table of contents, signup form, and coaching prompt didn't do it for you, <strong>write me at josh@joshpetersel.com</strong> and we'll figure something else out. I think anyone earnest who asks for 20 minutes of help should get it &mdash; if you're not sure if that's you, or if you think you might like to work together, or anything else... well, no harm now in dropping me a line. <br><br>
