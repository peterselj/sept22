			<strong>Hello, I'm Josh &mdash; </strong>
		</div>
			<p>I write essays into Google Docs. <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsQd81HoM8uAMsGKWeiyORkybQi_CRlQr0sZCfe-vX4/edit'>Here's the table of contents</a>. <br><br>

				Actually, they're a bit more than essays; they're more like foundation points for dialogue. I dunno, this space has always been hard for me to <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pb78GLqphtYc8AetFgH0hqtABYAMVDnCETa4Z_i_rK4/edit?usp=sharing'>define precisely</a>... but maybe that's kind of the point, and anyway I hope you like it. <br><br>

				Check out the Featured Essays below if you'd like a sample of the dialogue experience. You can <a href='http://goo.gl/forms/rwtZWja4Ps'>sign up here</a> to get new stuff by email.

			<p>
			<b>Slow Jams:</b> I used to run a music magazine. I've traveled the world to cover concerts. I've logged years of working at Spotify. One surprising thing I've found: I'm tired of discovering music. It's exhausting. I think it's time we slow down, and give music a chance to be something more than just a treadmill of fleeting aural fixations. Here's why and how <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNx0V_wczJ3s19I3GRDIllGKftEKRrTMjjAeP2pbAyE/edit?usp=sharing'>I practice listening to music slowly</a>.</p><br>

			<p><b>Nobody says "brb" anymore</b>. You ever notice that? I think we've developed a subtle <i>accountability</i> for (not just addiction to) our online presence, and illustrate how I practice <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6VK3Alqi70eH_EyhRE3V3Yv9kmYJGKtolPrG0dg5Xg/edit?usp=sharing'>being unaccountable online</a>.</p>

			<p><b>Measuring:</b> We're maniacal about measuring what we do and whether we're doing it well. But seldom talked about is the other side of the coin: When <i>shouldn't</i> we measure? When might measuring go wrong? Turns out, we often don't just measure what we make, but wind up <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nopc7-IOMhMV5LUesF864xuw9eN3uJ9hw2JKAvQFQJM/edit'>making what we measure</a>.</p>

			<p><b>Self-Driving Cars</b> are going to change <i>everything</i>. Life with autonomous cars will hopefully be better, but inarguably it's going to be <i>weirder</i>. For speculative non-fiction, see <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlQlevmR-CVNODiaY-c1Y0FOAEp8kTzKXhANxbp1NlU/edit'>my terrible anxiety about our future in self-driving cars</a>.

		<h2><span id='Past'></span></h2>
			<p> Before these docs, <a href='https://www.joshpetersel.com/blog/'>I kept a blog</a> for about 10 years. One time <a href='https://joshpetersel.com/blog/i-built-a-calculator/'>I Built a Calculator</a>. I've written for Consequence of Sound, Forbes, The Next Web, The Inertia, The Harbus, and of course, a litany of pieces for my old company <i>Eleven Magazine</i>.
			</p>

		<h2><br><span id='Etc'></span>Careers Services</h2>
			<p>One way I pay it forward is by occasionally performing careers services (Resume, Search, and Interview prep) for up-and-coming graduates who are business-minded and looking to work in tech. I've helped people land roles they love (Product Managers, Business Analysts, etc.) at growth startups to FAANG companies. <br><br>
			
			My essay <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hVVFXpEom4SqAKpaskasct6qR7dWwlRz6kqWX0JRrA/edit>Getting a job at a Blockbuster</a> consolidates my broad industry observations and my most common pragmatic tactics. To find time for 1:1 perspective on your unique situation, <a href='mailto:josh@joshpetersel.com'>email me directly</a>.

		<h2 id='Things'>Hello #2</h2>
		<p>
			Personally: I live in Toronto; I emigrated from Brooklyn, NY. I love it here, which seems to surprise lots of people. Every year I throw a party where we play Berlin-style ping pong (I do it for the people, not the ping pong). My favorite music genre is if you imagine <a href='https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5T6fDBjCsHCsN5VCeakt1Y?si=6ddf4034b1a043d3'>the BeeGees, but modern, with upbeat tempo masking somber lyrics</a>. My favorite joke is the kind that takes years to tell, and is fun to tell repeatedly. I call my parents every week.<br><br>

		Professionally: I'm a Director at Spotify, where I build revenue systems and lead a team with the ultimate mission of making music accessible &amp; sustainable. I'm a fierce customer advocate. I'm a Harvard MBA, but don't identify with the mental image many seem to carry of that school's alums.  I often rely on data to make decisions... but also know when it's time to trust my experience &amp; instincts.

		<h2 id='Signature'><br>Goodbye</h2>
			<p>This webpage isn't designed to update often; there's not much more for visitors to do here. If the table of contents and signup form didn't do it for you, <strong>write me at josh@joshpetersel.com</strong> and we'll figure something else out. I think anyone earnest who asks for 20 minutes of help should get it &mdash; if you're not sure if that's you, or if you think you might like to work together, or anything else, well, no harm now in dropping me a line. <br><br>

			Sincerely,<br><br>
